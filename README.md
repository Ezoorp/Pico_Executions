# Pico_Executions

This project aims to explain how to get started with Raspberry Pi Pico on Windows (using the C/C++ SDK) and other RP2040-based boards. It is inspired by, and is roughly equivalent to, the pico-setup project for Linux systems.

# General Software Setup

Begin by downloading [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it offers many tools (compiling, debugging, and extensions).
